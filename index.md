# Suhaas Nachannagari's First CS 193 Homework

My favorite things about CS 193:
- Terminal is really fun to play around with, especially when you get stuck on random commands where theres no going back
- Just listening and then fine tuning your ears to pick up whenever the code word for the day is dropped at random is challenging but funny
- University Church is a nice place
